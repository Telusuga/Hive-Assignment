1)What is the definition of Hive? What is the present version of Hive? 
Answer:Hive is a computation engine in which it runs on top of MAP REDUCE Program.In order to write a Map Reduce code is written in JAVA in order to reduce the overhead of writing multiple lines of code.
Instead of writing code in MAP REDUCE we can use Hive Query Language(HQL) in order to get the results.
Version--->Hive 1.1.0-cdh5.13.0
Present hive version-->3.1.3

2)Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems? Why?
Answer:Hive basically supports OLAP because it has the capability to do the analysis on top of huge amount of data.
Hive is very much suitable for batch processing and it doesnot support inserts and updates at row level.
But in the later versions of hive it also supports the updates after 0.14.

3)How is HIVE different from RDBMS? Does hive support ACID transactions. If not then give the proper reason
Answer:In general RDBMS we perform general SQL operations on a database but in Hive the operations are performed on Data warehouse.
One of the main difference is Hive is "Schema On Read" where as general RDBMS is "Schema On Write". Hive does support ACID properties.
For a table to perform ACID properties it must follow 4 steps:
(a) It must be a Internal/Managed Table.
(b) It should be bucketed/clustered.
(c) The table format must be in ORC.
(d) The transactional Property should be set to true.
Note: The ACID properties came into hive starting from Version 0.14.

4)Explain the hive architecture and the different components of a Hive architecture?
Answer:The main components of Hive are 
a)Driver: This is the main part in Hive in which it contains 4 main blocks:
                                                      1)Parser:This is used to check the syntax and schemantics.
                                                      2)Planner:This is used to put out the various execution plans.
                                                      3)Optimizer:This is used to select the best execution plan in which is low in terms of cost and faster in execution.
                                                      4)Executioner:This is used to execute the output plan of the optimizer. The execution is mainly done by Map-Reduce code

b)Metastore: DerbyDB is used as a Metastore in which it is used to store the metainfo.

c)Thrift: This is a daemon service in Hive which allows the connectivity of other services to connect to Hive through ODBC/JDBC connections.

d)CLI: Through HUE we can connect to Hive and perform analytics using HUE.
